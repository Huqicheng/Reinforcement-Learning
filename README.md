Reinforcement Learning
-------------------------

## K-armed Bandit Problem

### 1. ϵ-greedy

Set a probability ϵ to randomly try a bandit, otherwise, the algorithm will pick the bandit which has the highest expectation value. 

### 2. Softmax

Pick bandit based on Boltzmann Distribution.

## Model-based Learning

### 1. Q Learning
